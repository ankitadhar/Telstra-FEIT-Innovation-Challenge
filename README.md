# Problem Statement
# Theme/problem statement:

Agriculture is critical to the human race. According to the UN, we’ll need to feed and clothe 10 billion people by 2050. And we need to do it sustainably and safely.

How can technology help us improve, better manage, and secure our agricultural output?​

# Aspects to Consider
Maximising yield and quality of production​

Better utilising assets, materials and natural resources in production to ensure both sustainability and economic benefit​

Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of both humans and animals involved in agriculture​

Providing end-to-end traceability and provenance as goods and produce move through the agri-food and agri-fibre supply chain​

Ensuring and proving compliance with regulation…and reducing the cost-of-compliance​
